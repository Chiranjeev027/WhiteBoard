# WhiteBoard

A collaborative online whiteboard application.

## Overview

WhiteBoard is a web-based tool that allows users to draw, sketch, and collaborate in real time on a digital canvas. The project is organized into two main directories:
- `Frontend`: Contains the client-side code for the user interface and interactions.
- `Backend`: Handles server-side logic, user sessions, and real-time data communication.

You can try the live application here: [WhiteBoard Live Demo](https://whiteboard-gamma-plum.vercel.app)
